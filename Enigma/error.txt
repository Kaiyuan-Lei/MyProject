GITBUG ERROR REPORT

Apple macOS

   directory when compiling and running your program.

proj1


4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.

My code produces the correct output for trivial.in and trivial1.in. However, for the riptide.inp, the first 4 lines are the same, but the last 2 are not.


5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.
